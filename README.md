Currently, I am learning 2D game development with Unity and studying C#. This is my first project following a video tutorial. 
I welcome everyone to take a look and provide feedback. 
The game I am working on is called Laser Defender. It's a 2D game where you control a spaceship to shoot down enemy spaceships, score points, and survive as long as possible.
